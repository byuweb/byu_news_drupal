> Drupal 8 module to integrate university news with your news.

## How It Works
You can sync as often as you desire with the university new site. When you do, new content types will be created as duplicates of the original story. It will give you the ability to change the story to meet your needs.

## This v. D8 New Module
The D8 new module is so you can use the `<byu-news>` component on your Drupal site. This module allows you to integrate university news into views with your news.
